    <!-- This is yours to discover and play with, enjoy with the edits below!
    Here are ideas:
    1. Make something like AdFly but for your own money! (Hire me to make a AdFly python implementation ;) )
    2. Add a custom redirect using bootstrap
    3. Maybe advertise something to the user while the page is loading?

    {% else %}
      <h1>Please wait {{ redirectTimeout }} seconds and you will be redirected...</h1>
    {% endif %}
